# RSC Emotional Simulation Videos

This repository contains the final simulation videos accompanying the paper:

***Emotive Design of a Robot Study Companion to Support University Learning***
Miriam Calafaâ€™, Farnaz Baksh, MatevÅ¾ B. Zorec, Karl KruusamÃ¤e
Presented at RO-MAN 2025

## Repository Structure

The videos are organized into three folders based on the voice type used in the vocal responses of the Robot Study Companion (RSC):

```
ðŸ“‚ Raymond
ðŸ“‚ Betty
ðŸ“‚ Robot
```

Each folder contains six video simulations representing the robotâ€™s emotional reactions in university-relevant scenarios:

* `anger.mp4`
* `joy.mp4`
* `fun.mp4`
* `surprise.mp4`
* `pride.mp4`
* `caring.mp4`

These videos illustrate the RSC's multimodal emotional expression system, integrating:

* Facial expressions and background colors
* Emotion-specific flipper motions
* Synchronized, emotionally congruent voice lines

## Purpose

The videos demonstrate how the RSC responds to common academic situations with context-appropriate emotional expressions across three modalities: **motion**, **facial display**, and **voice**. Each simulation aligns with one of the six target emotions designed to support studentsâ€™ emotional engagement and motivation.

The paper will be made available following publication.
